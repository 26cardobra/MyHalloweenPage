      <h2>Here are some Halloween Fact:</h2>
      <p>
         <ul>
         <li>The fear of Halloween is called Samhainophobia, while the fear of candy is called Nonsense.</li>

            <li>Guinness World Record for the heaviest Pumpkin of all time is 2,624.6lbs held by grower Mathias Willemijns of Belgium.</li>
            
            <li>John Carpenter’s 1978 horror film, “Halloween,” was filmed in 21 days.</li>
            
            <li>Many stores ban masks on Halloween to prevent robberies but require them due to COVID-19. Choose your mask wisely, I suppose.</li>
            
            <li>About ¼ of annual candy sales in the US are for Halloween.</li>
            
            <li>20% of millennials bought costumes for their pets in 2018. Why? Because it’s adorable.</li>
            
            <li>Fears of Halloween candy being poisoned are unfounded, as the few incidents over the years were found to be family-related crimes.</li>
            
            <li>Candy corn was originally called “chicken feed.” Now it is just called gross.</li>
            
            <li>Finding a spider on Halloween night is considered good luck, unless it’s in your shoe. That’s just scary.</li>
            
            <li>The first Jack-O’-Lanterns were carved from turnips because no one wants to eat turnips.</li>
         </ul>
